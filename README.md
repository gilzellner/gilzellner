### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on Infrastructure at Hourone.ai, so less coding for now.

I like: 

- Golang
- DDD
- Microservices 
- Python
- AWS
- Docker 
- Git 
- Jenkins 
- Gitlab CI 
- Windows for gaming\media, but not for work 
- Mac for work but not for play 
- Linux for servers
- Intellij IDEA
- iTerm
- Slack
- Zoom

I dislike: 
- Chef 
- Bash 
- Openstack 
- Ruby (because of the ecosystem) 
- Java (because of the large boilerplate)
- Scala 
- Windows for work
- Mac for Play
- Linux for desktop (If I need to recompile another driver set again...)
- Cisco Security products
-
